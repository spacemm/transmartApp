For development,\r\na copy of [grails][1] is needed in order to run the application. For production\r\nor evaluation purposes, it is sufficient to download a pre-build WAR file, for\r\ninstance a snapshot from the [The Hyveʼs][2] or [tranSMART Foundationʼs][3]\r\nCI/build servers, for snapshots of The Hyveʼs or tranSMART Foundationʼs GitHub\r\nrepositories, respectively. In order to run the WAR, an application server is\r\nrequired. The only supported one is [Tomcat][4], either from the 6.x or 7.x\r\nline, though it will most likely work on others.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a PostgreSQL database installed with the proper schema and data is\r\nrequired. As of this moment, The Hyveʼs development branches require this to be\r\npropared with the [transmart-data][5] repository. This project also handles\r\nthe required configuration, running the Solr instances and, for development\r\npurposes, running an R server and installing sample data.\r\n\r\nFor details on how to install the tranSMART Foundationʼs versions, refer to\r\n[their wiki][6].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://grails.org/\r\n  [2]: https://ci.ctmtrait.nl/\r\n  [3]: https://ci.transmartfoundation.org/\r\n  [4]: http://tomcat.apache.org/\r\n  [5]: https://github.com/thehyve/transmart-data\r\n  [6]: https://wiki.transmartfoundation.org/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
